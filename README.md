# Customizing-EditorKit
Stuff from http://java-sl.com/

All the code you can find here or libraries (.jar files) which you can download are free. You can use it or extend/modify it as you wish. The only request is to add reference to [the author](http://java-sl.com/about_author.html) in the used code snippets.

If it's your first EditorKit customizing project or you miss some basic concepts you can start from the [EditorKit concepts and tutorial](/docs/concepts.md) to understand how it's organized and works.
